image moments:
    Image Moment is a particular weighted average of image pixel intensities

Support Vector Machines:
    supervised machine learning model
    binary classifier, it is or it is not
    - the hyperplane (line in 2d) that seperates the tags is known as the decision boundary
    - maximize the margin between data and hyperplane
    - C: Tradeoff between  reducing margin but more accuratley prediciting
    - Gamma: Convert no linear data into linear using the Kernel trick (Radial Basis Function)
        - adding a dimension
        - how much the data is stretched in the third dimension, need to pick just the right value
    - support vectors are data points close to the plane

Histogram of oriented gradients:
    - used in object detection
    - The technique counts occurrences of gradient orientation (edge directions) in localized portions of an image
    - image is divided into cells
    - histogram of gradient direction is calculated in each cell
    - cv::sobel:
        - calculate the gradient of the image
        - the greater the change in gradient of the image, the greate the change in the image
    - its an array where each index corresponds direction and value is magnitude

deskew:
    - preproccessing the image
    - get rid of slants

ColorSpaces:
    - RGB
        It is an additive colorspace where colors are obtained by a linear combination of Red, Green, and Blue values.
        The three channels are correlated by the amount of light hitting the surface.
    - HSV: Hue (Dominant WaveLength), Saturation (Purity/shade of colour), Value (Intensity) 
        Only one channel
        Good under differnt lighting
