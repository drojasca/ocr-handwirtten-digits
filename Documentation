Day 1:
I am just trying to create a launch file that would open the camera
I found a driver that was installed with: sudo apt install ros-melodic-usb-cam
Was able to create open the camera with their launch file

Day 2:
Created subscirber node that listens to the image that is being received

Day 3:
source devel/setup.bash
Read up on HOG and SVM and how to deskew an image, the applied the deskew to the image

Day 4:
 Learned about colour space and how changing it helps with object detection
 will start looking at how live detect and how to train

Day 5:
    Made the HOG
Day 6:
    trained the model

        - Contouring Images

Basic OCR using Hog features and an SVM.

The program will take an image with handwritten digits on a plain background. It will find the contours of the image, then predict the value of the contours found.
The goal is to familiarize myself with ROS and OpenCv. 

To Use:

- Install Ros Melodic;
- go to directory of project
- run script
- Paste image into terminal and press enter, anotated image will be displayed in RQT
chmod +x <fileName>.
